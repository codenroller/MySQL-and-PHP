    <h1>Using MySQL and PHP</h1>
	
	<p>
		The goal of the project is to go through MySQL database basics.
		We will be focusing on tasks and problems that are common in web development.
		The main focus of the project is on MySQL database. However it is also important 
		to understand how to combine web technologies to achieve the desired result.
		So we will go through a couple of examples that use MySQL and PHP together.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Keywords:</h3>
	<p>
		MySQL, SQL, PHP, relational database, data integrity, data constraints, 
		data type, table, query, view, transaction.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Assignment:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Create a new database named <span class="highlight">jeux-video</span>. 
			For starters you have a MySQL code that creates the tables in DB. 
			The initial script is saved in the project root directory as 
			<span class="highlight">initial_script.sql</span>.
			Go through the code, apply changes if necessary.
			Explain the changes you have applied. Execute the final version of your script. 
			Now nou are good to go! :)
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Write a query showing all video games in alphabetical order. The query should 
			return: (a) game id; (b) game name; (c) name of owner; (d) name of console;
			(e) game price. Save your script as <span class="highlight">qr_video_games.sql</span>. 
			
			Create a view based on the written query. Name the view 
			<span class="highlight">vw_video_games</span> 
			and save the script as <span class="highlight">vw_video_games.sql</span>.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Write a query that displays all the games owned by Patrick. Games should be displayed
			in alphabetical order. Save the script under the name 
			<span class="highlight">qr_games_owner_patrick.sql</span>.
			
			Write a PHP script displaying a list of video games belonging to each owner. 
			The owners and the games should be listed in alphabetical order. 
			Save the script under the name <span class="highlight">owners.php</span>.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Write a PHP script displaying a list of video games for each of the consoles.
			The consoles and the games should be listed in alphabetical order.
			Save your script under the name <span class="highlight">consoles.php</span>.			
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Write a query showing only the games starting from 'M'. 
			The query should return: (a) game id; (b) game name; (c) name of owner; (d) name of console;
			(e) game price. Name the script <span class="highlight">qr_video_games_m.sql</span>. 
			To keep things simple you are allowed to use the view 
			<span class="highlight">vw_video_games</span> that you created in the previous task.			
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Write a query that displays games with id of a console that is not registered in the 
			table <span class="highlight">console</span>.
		</li>
